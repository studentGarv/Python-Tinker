## File Overview

### Core Application Files
- **`launcher.py`** - Main launcher (start here)
- **`thinker_app.py`** - Command-line interface
- **`thinker_gui.py`** - Graphical interface
- **`demo.py`** - Demonstration script

### Documentation
- **`README.md`** - Complete user guide
- **`SETUP.md`** - This setup guide
- **`requirements.txt`** - Dependencies (none needed!)

### Launch Scripts
- **`start_thinker.bat`** - Windows batch launcher
- **`start_thinker.ps1`** - PowerShell launcher

### Data Files (created automatically)
- **`thoughts.json`** - Your saved thoughts and sessions
- **`demo_thoughts.json`** - Sample data from demo
- **`*.txt`** / **`*.md`** - Exported session files

## Troubleshooting

### "Python not found"
- Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- Make sure "Add to PATH" is checked during installation
- Restart terminal/command prompt after installation

### "tkinter not found" (GUI only)
- tkinter is usually included with Python
- On Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- Use CLI version as alternative: `python thinker_app.py`

### Permission Issues
- Make sure you have write permissions in the app folder
- On macOS/Linux: `chmod +x *.py`

### GUI Not Starting
- Try the CLI version first: `python thinker_app.py`
- Check if tkinter is available: `python -c "import tkinter"`
- Use the launcher: `python launcher.py` â†’ choose option 1

## Getting Started

### First Run
1. **Launch the app**: `python launcher.py`
2. **Choose interface**: CLI (1) or GUI (2)
3. **Create session**: Give it a descriptive title
4. **Add thoughts**: Start with a few ideas
5. **Try brainstorming**: Use the brainstorm mode
6. **Export session**: Save to TXT or Markdown

### Sample Workflow
1. **Morning Planning**: Create "Today's Goals" session
2. **Project Work**: Create project-specific sessions
3. **Brainstorming**: Use dedicated brainstorm sessions
4. **Review & Export**: Export completed sessions

## Advanced Setup

### Custom Data Location
```python
# Edit thinker_app.py to change default data file
app = ThinkerApp("my_custom_thoughts.json")
```

### Multiple Data Files
- Use GUI's Load Data feature
- Or manually copy different JSON files
- Great for separating work/personal thoughts

### Backup Strategy
- Regular backup of `thoughts.json`
- Export important sessions to TXT/MD
- Version control the JSON file (optional)

## Integration Ideas
