## 💡 Tips for Effective Thinking

### Organization Strategies
- **Use descriptive session titles**: "Q1 Marketing Ideas" vs "Ideas"
- **Categorize thoughtfully**: group, goals, tasks, ideas, questions
- **Set meaningful priorities**: 1=someday, 3=important, 5=urgent
- **Tag consistently**: use tags like #research, #action, #discuss

### Brainstorming Best Practices
- **Start with a clear goal**: What are you trying to solve/explore?
- **Capture everything**: Don't filter during brainstorming
- **Use brainstorm mode**: It's optimized for rapid idea capture
- **Review and prioritize**: After brainstorming, organize your thoughts
- **Export and share**: Use markdown export for team collaboration

### Workflow Examples

**Daily Planning:**
1. Create session: "Daily Goals - [Date]"
2. Add thoughts for tasks, ideas, reminders
3. Set priorities based on importance/urgency
4. Mark completed throughout the day

**Project Brainstorming:**
1. Create session: "Project X - Initial Ideas"
2. Use brainstorm mode for 15-30 minutes
3. Categorize ideas: features, concerns, resources
4. Export to markdown for team review

**Learning Notes:**
1. Create session: "Course Notes - [Subject]"
2. Add key concepts as thoughts
3. Tag by topic: #definitions, #examples, #questions
4. Export for study material

## 🎯 Advanced Features

## 🔧 Customization

### Data File Location
By default, data is saved to `thoughts.json`. You can:
- Load different data files using the GUI
- Backup your data by copying the JSON file
- Share sessions by exporting to TXT/MD format

### Extending the App
The modular design makes it easy to add features:
- Custom export formats
- Integration with other tools
- Additional thought metadata
- Cloud storage sync

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"GUI version requires tkinter"**
- tkinter is usually included with Python
- On Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- Use CLI version as alternative

**"Data not saving"**
- Check file permissions in the app directory
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Try manual save command

**"Session not found"**
- Use exact session ID from the sessions list
- Check if session was accidentally deleted
- Create new session if needed
